/**
 * menu-aim is a jQuery plugin for dropdown menus that can differentiate
 * between a user trying hover over a dropdown item vs trying to navigate into
 * a submenu's contents.
 *
 * menu-aim assumes that you have are using a menu with submenus that expand
 * to the menu's right. It will fire events when the user's mouse enters a new
 * dropdown item *and* when that item is being intentionally hovered over.
 *

 * | Monkeys  >|   Gorilla  |
 * | Gorillas >|   Content  |
 * | Chimps   >|   Here     |
 * |___________|____________|
 *
 * In the above example, "Gorillas" is selected and its submenu content is
 * being shown on the right. Imagine that the user's cursor is hovering over
 * "Gorillas." When they move their mouse into the "Gorilla Content" area, they
 * may briefly hover over "Chimps." This shouldn't close the "Gorilla Content"
 * area.
 *
 * This problem is normally solved using timeouts and delays. menu-aim tries to
 * solve this by detecting the direction of the user's mouse movement. This can
 * make for quicker transitions when navigating up and down the menu. The
 * experience is hopefully similar to amazon.com/'s "Shop by Department"
 * dropdown.
 *
 * Use like so:
 *
 *      $("#menu").menuAim({
 *          activate: $.noop,  // fired on row activation
 *          deactivate: $.noop  // fired on row deactivation
 *      });
 *
 *  ...to receive events when a menu's row has been purposefully (de)activated.
 *
 * The following options can be passed to menuAim. All functions execute with
 * the relevant row's HTML element as the execution context ('this'):
 *
 *      .menuAim({
 *          // Function to call when a row is purposefully activated. Use this
 *          // to show a submenu's content for the activated row.
 *          activate: function() {},
 *
 *          // Function to call when a row is deactivated.
 *          deactivate: function() {},
 *
 *          // Function to call when mouse enters a menu row. Entering a row
 *          // does not mean the row has been activated, as the user may be
 *          // mousing over to a submenu.
 *          enter: function() {},
 *
 *          // Function to call when mouse exits a menu row.
 *          exit: function() {},
 *
 *          // Selector for identifying which elements in the menu are rows
 *          // that can trigger the above events. Defaults to "> li".
 *          rowSelector: "> li",
 *
 *          // You may have some menu rows that aren't submenus and therefore
 *          // shouldn't ever need to "activate." If so, filter submenu rows w/
 *          // this selector. Defaults to "*" (all elements).
 *          submenuSelector: "*",
 *
 *          // Direction the submenu opens relative to the main menu. Can be
 *          // left, right, above, or below. Defaults to "right".
 *          submenuDirection: "right"
 *      });
